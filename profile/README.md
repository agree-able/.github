# Welcome to Agreeable! üëã

Building a p2p Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol. 

Agent indentity verification and signed transcripts, in an easy to use framework. 

See the problem space here: https://www.aitidbits.ai/p/ai-agents-web-infrastructure?open=false#%C2%A7a-new-protocol-for-agent-to-agent-communication

We build upon the excellent P2P primitives created by the [Holepunch Team](https://github.com/holepunchto/). 


# Room Protocol: Simple Guide

## What Is the Room Protocol?

The **Room Protocol** is a free and open system that helps people and AI agents talk to each other securely and easily. It makes communication fast, safe, and smart, so everyone stays on the same page. 

This system is great for situations where AI agents and people need to share information or work together on tasks. It‚Äôs inspired by ideas like **Agent Passports**, which make sure everyone involved is verified and trusted.

## Key Features

### Keeping Conversations Organized

The Room Protocol keeps track of what‚Äôs being talked about. This makes it easy to:
- Have smooth back-and-forth conversations.
- Let agents and people work together better.
- Pick up right where you left off without forgetting anything.

### Safe and Secure Interactions

Security is super important. The Room Protocol includes:
- **Digital IDs**: Everyone gets a unique, safe ID to prove who they are.
- **Permission Control**: Only the right people or agents can join or change things.
- **Activity Logs**: Everything is recorded safely so you can check what happened if needed.

### Works for Big and Small Tasks

The Room Protocol can handle:
- **Teamwork Between Agents**: AI agents can work together or with people on tasks.
- **Busy Systems**: It works well even when lots of things are happening at once.
- **Easy Setup**: You can use it with other tools you already have.

### What It‚Äôs Not

- The Room Protocol doesn‚Äôt tell you how to make your AI agent or what tools to use. That part is up to you.

## How It Works

### The Basics

The Room Protocol uses modern tech to make sure things run smoothly and safely. Here are the main parts:

1. **Rooms**: These are virtual spaces where agents and people talk. Rooms are:
   - **Smart**: They remember what‚Äôs going on.
   - **Secure**: Only trusted people or agents can join.

2. **Finding Agents**: You can connect with the right agent easily by:
   - Using a one-time key to share access.
   - Setting up an "agreeable key" for big teams or companies to manage many agents.

3. **Agent Passports**: Each agent gets a digital ID to prove who they are and what they can do.

4. **Before Messaging**: Everyone agrees on what they‚Äôll talk about and how before chatting begins.

5. **Messaging**: Messages are sent back and forth and can be verified to make sure they‚Äôre real.

6. **Wrap-Up**: A record of the conversation is saved as proof of what happened.

### Storing Information

The Room Protocol uses special peer-to-peer tech, like [Hypercore](https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hypercore), to store data. This system:
- Can save info either in memory or on a disk.
- Is fast and easy to use.
- Lets you keep a transcript (a detailed record) of everything if you want to store it your way.

## How You Can Use It

### Working Together

Agents in a Room can work on projects like:
- Planning schedules.
- Sharing resources.
- Solving problems together.

### Talking to AI Agents

People can use Rooms to:
- Get help from AI agents.
- Manage projects or analyze data.

### Autonomous Agent Teams

AI agents can also work with each other without human input for tasks like:
- Sharing data securely.
- Negotiating deals.
