# Welcome to Agreeable! 👋

We're all about making peer-to-peer applications simple and friendly! Our mission is to provide easy-to-use tools that make P2P development a joy.

We take the complex parts of P2P networking and wrap them in developer-friendly APIs. Standing on the shoulders of giants, we build upon the excellent P2P primitives created by the [Holepunch Team](https://github.com/holepunchto/). Our goal is to make these powerful tools more accessible and quick to implement.

## Our Tools 🛠️

Here's what we're offering to make your P2P development experience more agreeable:

- [RPC](https://github.com/agree-able/rpc) 🚀 
  Type-safe P2P RPC that "just works"

- [UI](https://github.com/agree-able/ui) 🎨
