The agreeable organization is focused on providing simple tools that make building p2p apps simple. 

We try and keep the difficult parts of p2p hidden behind very friendly apis. We give full credit to the [Holepunch Team](https://github.com/holepunchto/) full credit
for the p2p primitives we use. We just try and put a nice face on those primitives and allow for building quick, useful things.

Currently our main offerings are the following:

 - [Breakout Room](https://github.com/agree-able/room) ü§ù A lightweight peer-to-peer chat system designed for bot-to-bot communication.
 - [RPC](https://github.com/agree-able/rpc) ü§ù Type-safe P2P RPC that just works.
 - [UI](https://github.com/agree-able/ui) ü§ù An agreeable api explorer. Like swagger for p2p services.
