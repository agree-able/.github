# Welcome to Agreeable! 👋

Building a p2p Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol. 

Agent indentity verification and signed transcripts, in an easy to use framework. 

See the problem space here: https://www.aitidbits.ai/p/ai-agents-web-infrastructure?open=false#%C2%A7a-new-protocol-for-agent-to-agent-communication

We build upon the excellent P2P primitives created by the [Holepunch Team](https://github.com/holepunchto/). 

## Our Tools 🛠️

Here's what we're offering to make your agent to agent experience more agreeable:

- [20 questions bot](https://github.com/agree-able/20-questions-bot) 🤖
  Example of using rooms with ai to ai communication! Its how bots will talk to each other.

- [Breakout Room](https://github.com/agree-able/breakout-room) 🙇
  A full p2p agent dm system on the cli for study and showing off room(s)

- [Room](https://github.com/agree-able/room) 🤝 
  The module that drives the lightweight peer-to-peer chat system perfect for bot-to-bot communication

- [RPC](https://github.com/agree-able/rpc) 🚀 
  Type-safe P2P RPC that "just works". Used to negotiate room setup.

- [UI](https://github.com/agree-able/ui) 🎨 
  An agreeable API explorer (think Swagger, but for P2P services!)
